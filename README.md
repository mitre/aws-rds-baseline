# aws-rds-infrastructure-cis-baseline

InSpec Profile to validate the secure configuration of aws-rds-infrastructure-cis-baseline, against CIS's Amazon Web Services Three-tier Web Architecture Benchmark V1.0.0

## Getting Started  
It is intended and recommended that InSpec run this profile from a __"runner"__ host (such as a DevOps orchestration server, an administrative management system, or a developer's workstation/laptop) against the target remotely over __<transport_protocol>__.


Latest versions and installation options are available at the [InSpec](http://inspec.io/) site.

The following attributes must be configured in an attributes file for the profile to run correctly. More information about InSpec attributes can be found in the [InSpec Profile Documentation](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/profiles/).

```
# Description of input value
input-name: default-value

# Database instance identifier
db_instance_identifier: []

# VPC Security Group Id
vpc_security_group_id: []]

# Allowed IP address range
allowed_ip_address_range: ''
```

## Usage

InSpec makes it easy to run your tests wherever you need. More options listed here: [InSpec cli](http://inspec.io/docs/reference/cli/)

```
# Clone Inspec Profile
$ git clone https://github.com/mitre/aws-rds-infrastructure-cis-baseline

# Set required ENV variables
$ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=key-id
$ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=access-key
$ export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=session_token
$ export AWS_REGION=us-west-1

# To run profile locally and directly from Github
$ inspec exec /path/to/profile -t aws:// 

# To run profile locally and directly from Github with cli & json output 
$ inspec exec /path/to/profile -t aws:// --reporter cli json:rds-results.json

# To run profile locally and directly from Github with cli & json output, in a specific region with a specific AWS profile
$ inspec exec /path/to/profile -t aws://us-east-1/<mycreds-profile> --reporter cli json:rds-results.json

```
## Viewing the JSON Results

The JSON results output file can be loaded into __[heimdall-lite](https://mitre.github.io/heimdall-lite/)__ for a user-interactive, graphical view of the InSpec results. 

The JSON InSpec results file may also be loaded into a __full heimdall server__, allowing for additional functionality such as to store and compare multiple profile runs.

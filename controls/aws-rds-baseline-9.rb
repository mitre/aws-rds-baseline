  desc "A security group acts as a virtual firewall for your instance to control
  inbound and outbound traffic. When you launch an instance in the AWS Virtual
  Private Cloud (VPC), you can assign the instance to up to five security groups.
  Security groups act at the instance level, not the subnet level. Therefore,
  each instance in a subnet in your VPC could be assigned to a different set of
  security groups. If you don't specify a particular group at launch time, the
  instance is automatically assigned to the default security group for the VPC.
  For each security group, you add rules that control the inbound traffic to
  instances, and a separate set of rules that control the outbound traffic."

  desc 'Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) is a managed relational database
  service which handles routine database tasks such as provisioning, patching,
  backup, recovery, failure detection, and repair.
  There are 6 database engines available for customer to run their database
  workloads on:
  * Amazon Aurora (MySQL Compatible)
  * MySQL
  * MariaDB
  * Oracle
  * Microsoft SQL Server
  * PostgreSQL
  Customers can deploy RDS databases within a VPC through the configuration of:
  * Subnet Group for RDS, this group will be used for deployment of single or
  Multi-AZ RDS instances.
  * Network access through configuration of Security Groups for RDS
  * Access from outside the VPC hosting the DB instance by enabling/disabling a
  Public
